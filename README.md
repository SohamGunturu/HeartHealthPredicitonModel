# Heart Health Prediction Model

This project is for PoweringSTEMHacks 2022 hackathon

The theme of the hackathon was: Medical Innovation

Create something that in some way will help a medical procedure or treatment! The theme is very broad so as long as it has some relation to the theme of medicine/healthcare it's in theme!
